            <p> (BTC) was the first cryptocurrency ever created back in 2009,
            and it remains the most popular and valuable digital currency in the world today.
            Bitcoin is a blockchain-based decentralized digital currency powered by
            a network of users who verify and record transactions without relying
            on a central authority or intermediary.
            Bitcoin is an alternative to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar,
            that are controlled by governments and central banks.
            Transactions are verified via a process known as a proof-of-work consensus mechanism.
            Bitcoin miners compete to verify transactions by
            solving complex mathematical functions using powerful computers.

            <p>It's no coincidence that Bitcoin was born during one of the most chaotic financial environments in U.S. history.
            During the global financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, distrust of banks and central governments was at a peak.</p>
